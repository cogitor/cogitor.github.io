# Who am I?
I'm a lead software engineer at [Zalando](https://www.zalando.de/) in Berlin, Germany. Before Germany, I have lived and worked in Ireland for the better part of a decade. I enjoy learning, building things and sharing what I've learned in the process.

<!--break-->

I love learning both new programming and natural languages. I believe that one should never be stuck with only one language - knowing more can only open new ways of thinking and conceptualising.

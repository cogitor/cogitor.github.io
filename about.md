# Who am I?
I'm a software engineering manager at [Zalando](https://www.zalando.de/) in Berlin, Germany. Before Germany, I lived and worked in Ireland for the better part of a decade. I enjoy learning, building things, and sharing what I've learned in the process.

I love learning both new programming and natural languages. I believe that one should never be limited to only one language — knowing more can only open new ways of thinking and conceptualizing.

# {{ page.title }}
I'm a software engineer at [Zalando](https://www.zalando.de/) in Berlin, Germany. I've recently moved from Ireland where I worked in [Swrve](http://swrve.com). I enjoy building web services, distributed systems, complaining about weather and working with functional languages. I especially enjoy [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

Beside programming languages, I love learning new natural languages as well. I believe that with both, one should never be stuck with only one language - knowing more can only open new ways of thinking and conceptualising.

title: Who am I?

# {{ page.title }}

I'm a software engineer at [Swrve](http://swrve.com) in Dublin, Ireland. I enjoy building web services, complaining about weather and working with functional languages. I especially enjoy [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

Beside programming languages, I love learning new natural languages as well.

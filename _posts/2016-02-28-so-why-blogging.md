I was asked a couple of times if I have a personal website, especially by non-techy friends who assume that if I can build one, I should have one. And I can't say they're wrong. But the answer was always no, with a rotation of various excuses and a feeling that I should probably do something about it—in some shape or form. As soon as I figure out the form.

The first idea that comes to mind is a personal weblog. After all, I do enjoy programming, solving problems, and learning about technologies — presumably the same as others who blog about it. My excuse was that I didn't feel I had the writing skills. You might know the feeling — you enjoy the resonance of the words in your head while reading through someone else's work and wish you could write as skillfully. But instead of trying, I kept telling myself that I'm a developer, that writing essays is not exactly my forté. Forgetting that only through practice can one excel, and that communication skills are key skills for engineers — just the same as a full list of other [Soft Skills](http://competency-matrix.blogspot.ie/2009/01/competency-matrix.html).

So I should now sit down and start writing. And you might want to do so as well, if you haven't already.

Here we go! Coming late to the game but I\'m finally diving into setting up a website on Github Pages. It\'s super fun and pretty simple to set up.

The [Github Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/) is a breeze, the [Jenkyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) too. Reading up on a couple of guides like [Jonathan McGlone\'s](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).. So far so good.
